*Yet another CLI for PasswordPusher*

This repository currently contains an experiment. TBH, mostly I want to try out
things, and get to use some Rust. I use Password Pusher anyways, and I found
that the current CLI tools are fairly incomplete. This tool will be as well for
the forseeable future... but maybe some day :)


## Building

It's rust, uses cargo. If you don't know how to use these you will have problems
in this early stage of the software. As soon as an actually usable binary is
produced, it will probably provided in the form of releases.
